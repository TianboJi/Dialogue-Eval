Feedback: The chatbots seemed to only know a few phrases each and kept repeating them. They tried to use "slang" but not correctly. They didn't pick up on any of the topics I mentioned, except when I said I enjoyed bird watching with my cats. The chat said "I have a dog"; but the next chat said that they did not have a dog.
