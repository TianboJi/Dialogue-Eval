Feedback: I really found that unpleasant, and I'm not sure why. Some if it is probably the futility of the task, knowing that I'm trying to have a conversation with a machine that isn't cooperating. Actually, that's probably the crux of it: these machines violate Grice's cooperative principle. It's like talking to an insane person, except worse, because there's not even a distorted self-awareness behind it.
