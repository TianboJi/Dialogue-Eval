User(1): i'm a cancer survivor.
Bot(1): i am sorry to hear that . i have lost most of my family to cancer .
User(2): That's hard. It seems that if you survive everything else, cancer gets you.
Bot(2): yep
User(3): Have you been screened?
Bot(3): not yet . i have to take some tests first .
User(4): The waiting can be difficult.
Bot(4): why is that ? do they not have to get screened
User(5): Yeah, but while they wait, there is all the unknowns.
Bot(5): why is that ? do they not have to get screened
User(6): At least once you know, you can take action.
Bot(6): that is totally right . so many chances are hard to deal with though . . .
User(7): Right. When I was sick and didn't know what it was, I was more scared than when I found out I had cancer, but there were treatment options.
Bot(7): treatment has come a long way .
User(8): And there are more treatments being discovered every day
Bot(8): that is true , these days i feel like i have to compete with every woman .
User(9): How so?
Bot(9): the process to get anything treated is just too long for no reason , and very costly
User(10): Oh. Well, I guess that's a good reason to get checked early and often.
Bot(10): oh yes , that is true .
