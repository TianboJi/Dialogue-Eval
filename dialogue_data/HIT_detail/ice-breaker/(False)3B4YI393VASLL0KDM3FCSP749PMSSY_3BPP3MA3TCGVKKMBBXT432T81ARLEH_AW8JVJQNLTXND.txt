Feedback: Oh, this was horrible! The chatbot didn't make any sense for most of the conversations. It kept repeating "sentences" and I really hesitate to use the word "sentence". I tried to have a conversation about the topic, but the chatbot would not say something related to the topic (and I didn't change the topic). I would love to do these if the chatbot was a better conversationalist!
