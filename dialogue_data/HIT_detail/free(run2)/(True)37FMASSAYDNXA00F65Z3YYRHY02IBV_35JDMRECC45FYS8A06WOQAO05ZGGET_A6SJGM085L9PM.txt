User(1): So are you going to vote this year?
Bot(1): i am going to be a rich man
User(2): Really? That’s extremely fortunate for you. I read an article radar where the 50 richest Americans are worth as much the bottom 50% or 165 million people.
Bot(2): i am sure you are rich . i am a general activist
User(3): I can’t say I am.
Bot(3): i am not sure if i could have a job
User(4): So you must be independently wealthy. I don’t particularly like my job but even if I didn’t need the money from working, I think I’d be bored to death after a month or so.
Bot(4): i am sorry to hear that . i am not sure if i could do that
User(5): My job isn’t too bad.
Bot(5): i am sorry to hear that . i am not sure if i could afford it
User(6): I work in the restaurant industry.
Bot(6): i am not sure if i could afford it
User(7): Well, you must have a ways to go before you become rich.
Bot(7): i will be rich . i am rich .
User(8): Wealth tends to stay with the wealthy. The whole trickle down thing didn’t really work as planned.
Bot(8): i will be rich . i will be rich .
User(9): You seem pretty obsessed with money. There are other things in life, you know.
Bot(9): i am sure you are rich . i am rich .
User(10): Nope, again I’m still not rich. Don’t foresee it in my future.

User(6): The fact is that most of us don’t do anything. We talk about how bad the effects of climate change are but still get into our single family cars to commute to work, use way too much energy. We seem to me unwilling to do anything that might inconvenience us even a little.
