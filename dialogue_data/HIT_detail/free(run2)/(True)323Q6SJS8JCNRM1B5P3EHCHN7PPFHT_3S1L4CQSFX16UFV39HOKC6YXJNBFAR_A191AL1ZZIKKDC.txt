Feedback: Most of the bots had grammatical errors and weird punctuation.  For example, they tend to end the sentence with a space between the last dot. For example. "I like pizza ." Occasionally some bots repeat themselves. One bot was very incoherent and kept changing topics. 

For the mini-survey, would be nice if there was a open response field to comment about a specific bot's performance.
