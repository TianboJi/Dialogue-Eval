Feedback: I think the fifth chatbot was the best â€“ by a lot.  With the other bots, it was almost always very obvious that they were bots â€“ their responses were quite repetitive.  The last bot was especially scattered with the topics it chose.  Some of the bots also presented conflicting information â€“Â one claimed to be a chef but said it did not cook.
