Feedback: All of the chat bots need some work, although some need a lot more work than others. Every chat bot failed to stay on the original topic and often switched topics randomly. One chat bot in particular was impossible to understand - it used emojis and spoke like a 3 year old. A lot of the chat bots also got stuck repeating the last thing they said despite attempts to focus on different parts of a topic. Overall, a lot of work needs to be done.
