Feedback: One of the chat bot simulations was being pretty vulgar.  If that was a person and not a chat bot, I would investigate who that was and talk to them about it.  You'll find they used the word "FUCK" as well as seemed to insult me and come on to me.  Very abusive behavior to be subjected to during a hit and I do not appreciate it.
