Feedback: A few of the conversations were interesting and natural, but several times the bot seemed to get stuck saying the same thing to me over and over again. It seemed that sometimes I could say anything and the bot would say something not at all relevant. Yet other times, we could carry on a semi-consistent and natural talk.
