Feedback: Overall, the chatbot's English was pretty good for being a bot, but the repetitive tendency to repeat things and the other tendency to change the topic abruptly was a little problematic. Sometimes, the bot's topic change did not make sense in what the bot was attempting to discuss. Some sentences did not make sense because of the context. However, there were times when the bot was consistent in conversation, and when the conversation was enjoyable.
