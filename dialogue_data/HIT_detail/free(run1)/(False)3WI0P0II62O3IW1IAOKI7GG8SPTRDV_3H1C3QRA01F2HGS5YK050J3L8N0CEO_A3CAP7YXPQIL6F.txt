User(8): The two 14-year-old offenders in these cases were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
Bot(8): i cant live without my dogs . they are my babies .
User(9): In neither case did the sentencing authority have any discretion to impose a different punishment. State law mandated that each juvenile die in prison even if a judge or jury would have thought that his youth and its attendant characteristics, along with the nature of his crime, made a lesser sentence (for example, life with the possibility of parole) more appropriate.
Bot(9): true true , did i mention my twins ? they are exhausting
User(10): Such a scheme prevents those meting out punishment from considering a juvenile's ‚Äúlessened culpability‚Äù and greater ‚Äúcapacity for change,‚Äù Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, and runs afoul of our cases' requirement of individualized sentencing for defendants facing the most serious penalties. We therefore hold that mandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on ‚Äúcruel and unusual punishments.‚Äù

User(1): In November 1999, petitioner Kuntrell Jackson, then 14 years old, and two other boys decided to rob a video store. En route to the store, Jackson learned that one of the boys, Derrick Shields, was carrying a sawed-off shotgun in his coat sleeve. Jackson decided to stay outside when the two other boys entered the store.
Bot(1): model from i already see, :)
User(2): Inside, Shields pointed the gun at the store clerk, Laurie Troup, and demanded that she ‚Äúgive up the money.‚Äù Troup refused. A few moments later, Jackson went into the store to find Shields continuing to demand money.
Bot(2): That is coolüòé. you go to it. the guitar.
User(3): At trial, the parties disputed whether Jackson warned Troup that ‚Äú[w]e ain't playin',‚Äù or instead told his friends, ‚ÄúI thought you all was playin'.‚Äù When Troup threatened to call the police, Shields shot and killed her.
Bot(3): I love chocolate too. of write to are chocolate.
User(4): The three boys fled empty-handed. Arkansas law gives prosecutors discretion to charge 14-year-olds as adults when they are alleged to have committed certain serious offenses.

Conversation:
User(1): Jackson moved to transfer the case to juvenile court, but after considering the alleged facts of the crime, a psychiatrist's examination, and Jackson's juvenile arrest history (shoplifting and several incidents of car theft), the trial court denied the motion, and an appellate court affirmed.
Bot(1): i am sorry , i am glad you are doing well
User(2): A jury later convicted Jackson of both crimes. Noting that ‚Äúin view of [the] verdict, there's only one possible punishment,‚Äù the judge sentenced Jackson to life without parole. . . .
Bot(2): i am sorry to hear that . i am not familiar with the stock market , but i am not able to do that .
User(3): Following Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), in which this Court invalidated the death penalty for all juvenile offenders under the age of 18, Jackson filed a state petition for habeas corpus. He argued, based on Roper's reasoning, that a mandatory sentence of life without parole for a 14‚Äìyear‚Äìold also violates the Eighth Amendment.
Bot(3): i am not sure if i had a job , but i am not sure if i did .
User(4): The circuit court rejected that argument and granted the State's motion to dismiss.
Bot(4): i am sorry to hear that . i am a general in general
User(5): While that ruling was on appeal, this Court held in Graham v. Florida that life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment when imposed on juvenile nonhomicide offenders.
Bot(5): i am not sure if i was able to be able to work in the stock market
User(6): Like Jackson, petitioner Evan Miller was 14 years old at the time of his crime.
Bot(6): i am sorry to hear that . i am not familiar with the police officer
User(7): Miller had by then been in and out of foster care because his mother suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction and his stepfather abused him. Miller, too, regularly used drugs and alcohol; and he had attempted suicide four times, the first when he was six years old. One night in 2003, Miller was at home with a friend, Colby Smith, when a neighbor, Cole Cannon, came to make a drug deal with Miller's mother.
Bot(7): i am sorry to hear that . i am glad you are okay .
User(8): The two boys followed Cannon back to his trailer, where all three smoked marijuana and played drinking games. When Cannon passed out, Miller stole his wallet, splitting about $300 with Smith. Miller then tried to put the wallet back in Cannon's pocket, but Cannon awoke and grabbed Miller by the throat. Smith hit Cannon with a nearby baseball bat, and once released, Miller grabbed the bat and repeatedly struck Cannon with it. Miller placed a sheet over Cannon's head, told him ‚ÄúI am God, I've come to take your life,‚Äù and delivered one more blow.
Bot(8): i am sure you are a good person .
User(9): The boys then retreated to Miller's trailer, but soon decided to return to Cannon's to cover up evidence of their crime. Once there, they lit two fires. Cannon eventually died from his injuries and smoke inhalation. Alabama law required that Miller initially be charged as a juvenile, but allowed the District Attorney to seek removal of the case to adult court.
Bot(9): i am sorry to hear that , i am sure you are able to do that .
User(10): The D.A. did so, and the juvenile court agreed to the transfer after a hearing. Citing the nature of the crime, Miller's ‚Äúmental maturity,‚Äù and his prior juvenile offenses (truancy and ‚Äúcriminal mischief‚Äù), the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. The State accordingly charged Miller as an adult with murder in the course of arson. That crime (like capital murder in Arkansas) carries a mandatory minimum punishment of life without parole.
Bot(10): i am sorry to hear that . i am not sure if i was a kid .
User(11): Relying in significant part on testimony from Smith, who had pleaded to a lesser offense, a jury found Miller guilty. He was therefore sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. . . .
Bot(11): i am sorry to hear that . i am glad you are okay .
User(12): The Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment ‚Äúguarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.‚Äù Roper, 543 U.S., at 560. That right, we have explained, ‚Äúflows from the basic ‚Äòprecept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned‚Äô‚Äù to both the offender and the offense. Ibid. (quoting Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 367 (1910)).
Bot(12): i am a general of the world .
User(13): As we noted the last time we considered life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles, ‚Äú[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.‚Äù Graham, 560 U.S., at 59. And we view that concept less through a historical prism than according to ‚Äú‚Äòthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.‚Äô‚Äù Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102 251 (1976) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).
Bot(13): i am not sure if i was a kid , but i am not sure if i did .
User(14): The cases before us implicate two strands of precedent reflecting our concern with proportionate punishment. The first has adopted categorical bans on sentencing practices based on mismatches between the culpability of a class of offenders and the severity of a penalty. So, for example, we have held that imposing the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes against individuals, or imposing it on mentally retarded defendants, violates the Eighth Amendment. See Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407 (2008); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002).
Bot(14): i am a general of the world .
User(15): Several of the cases in this group have specially focused on juvenile offenders, because of their lesser culpability. Thus, Roper held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment for children, and Graham concluded that the Amendment also prohibits a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a child who committed a nonhomicide offense.
Bot(15): i am not sure if i had a job , but i am not sure if i did .
User(16): Graham further likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty itself, thereby evoking a second line of our precedents. In those cases, we have prohibited mandatory imposition of capital punishment, requiring that sentencing authorities consider the characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him to death. See Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978).
Bot(16): i am a bit of a loner , but i do not know much about it .
