User(1): Hi, whats your favorite animal?
Bot(1): i do not have a favorite . i cannot pick one . what is your favorite animal ?
User(2): I love so many of them, it is hard to pick one! Besides my dog and cat, I also love elephants, otters, panda bears, and monkeys
Bot(2): my favorite are otters and elephants .
User(3): Monkeys can be so funny!
Bot(3): haha monkeys are fun to watch for sure
User(4): otters are so sweet! I love watching them swim with their babies on the stomachs or swimming/napping holding hands with their mate
Bot(4): my favorite are otters and elephants .
User(5): elephants are so big yet you can almost read their feelings through their eyes!
Bot(5): they really are . they are so intuitive and loving . totally misunderstood
User(6): we have a couple of things in common, elephants and otters, and agree that Monkeys are funny to watch. I enjoy going to the zoo to watch and see all the animals, do you?
Bot(6): at the zoo , i find it easier to interact with animals than people ! haha !
User(7): You nailed it, about the zoo and interacting with the animals! I agree with you about what you said about the elephants.
Bot(7): what is your favorite animal to take care of at the zoo ?
User(8): Do you have any pets?
Bot(8): i do not , but i would love a dog ! are they hard to keep up with ?
User(9): Their is alot of responsibility taking care of a dog, or any other animal I would suppose. You have to a responsible person to take on such an important commitment. It is like taking care of a child. When I am at the zoo, when I was a child we were allowed to feed the animals, I would love to feed the giraffes and monkeys. If I had the chance I think I would love to take care of the panda bears and Otters :) How about you?

User(10): I adore them as well. What are your dog and cats name?
