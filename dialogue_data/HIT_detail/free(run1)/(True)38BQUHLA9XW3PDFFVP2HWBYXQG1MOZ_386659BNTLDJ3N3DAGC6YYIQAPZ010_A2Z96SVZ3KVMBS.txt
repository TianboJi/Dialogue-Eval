Feedback: The chatbots all seemed underdeveloped. They don't speak in normal casual English, and they don't use any punctuation. That made it hard to know what they were trying to communicate occasionally..

Bot(2): yes
User(3): Why don't you have a pet?
Bot(3): his
User(4): Hmm. I think I lost you. Are you saying your husband doesn't like pets?
Bot(4): i do not care about your husband
User(5): Wow. I don't have a husband. If I were married, though, I'd want a husband who likes pets.
Bot(5): i see . does that mean that you want an open relationship ?
User(6): Bizarre response. Umm. No. My husband needs to be faithful to me.
Bot(6): you sound confused . are you drunk or maybe slow ?
User(7): I think maybe you're drunk. If you had a pet, what animal would you want?
Bot(7): that s a strange thing to say . are you drinking and driving ?
User(8): We're supposed to be talking about pets. I'm pretty sure you're drunk, though.
Bot(8): that s a strange thing to say . are you drinking and driving ?
User(9): Like I said previously, you must be drunk. I am not driving, and I don't drink. You're pretty offensive for a chatbot.
Bot(9): that s a strange thing to say . are you drinking and driving ?
User(10): I think you're stuck. You might need to reboot yourself to see if you can come up with a different response.
Bot(10): you sound confused . are you drunk or maybe slow ?
